# Agentic Seek Front (TypeScript)

This is an experimental rewrite of the Novah frontend using React + TypeScript with TailwindCSS and Framer Motion. It implements a component-based UI with a Home page and dynamic Chat view.

The code resides in `src/` with reusable components like `PromptInput`, `AgentPane`, `ChatBubble`, and `FinalReportCard`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` – run the dev server
- `npm run build` – create a production build

This project is designed to talk to the existing backend running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
